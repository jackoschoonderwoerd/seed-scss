<h2>A complex, balanced Tripel</h2>
<p>Westmalle Tripel (9.5%) is a clear Trappist beer, golden-yellow in colour, with amazingly fruity aromas of ripe
  banana and a lovely, subtle nose of hops. This full-mouthed beer offers finesse and elegance, with a mild taste and
  a creamy mouth feel, yielding bitter notes supported by fruit aromas. Enjoy the lingering, dry finish.&nbsp; The
  complex character of a Westmalle Tripel is derived from the slow brewing process and its re-fermentation in the
  bottle.</p>
<p>Westmalle Tripel is usually poured from 33 cl bottles into the branded chalice that perfectly holds the contents of
  one bottle. The Tripel can also be bought in&nbsp;75 cl bottles.&nbsp;In larger bottles, the beer matures in a
  different way; the fruity aromas are milder with a greater touch of ripeness and the beer takes on a subtle hint of
  vanilla.</p>
<h2>Original from the start</h2>
<p>Westmalle Tripel was first brewed in 1934. This ‘mother of all tripels’ is a world reference for the style and has
  inspired numerous brewers. Westmalle Tripel was introduced at the time of the launch of the abbey’s new brewing
  hall. The recipe was adjusted in 1956 but ever since then the recipe has remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Westmalle Tripel was added to the range in the 1930s. ‘Tripel’ refers to the fact that ingredients are used in
  quantities that are larger than usual. In other words, this strong blonde contains three times the quantity of
  ingredients that was used for the original Westmalle Trappist beer. Other brewers have since adopted the ‘tripel’
  name for their own beers.</p>
