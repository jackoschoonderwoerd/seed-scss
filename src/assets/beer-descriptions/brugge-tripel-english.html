<h2>Bruges “gruut”</h2>
<p>The secret of the BRUGGE Tripel city beer is the unique composition of the “gruut” blend&nbsp;of herbs and spices
  used to enrich its flavour and aroma. In Bruges, anyone brewing&nbsp;beer was obliged to purchase “gruut” from the
  city’s herbs and spices shop, known as&nbsp;the “Gruuthuse”. Jan van Brugge and his descendents, who later changed
  their name&nbsp;to Van Gruuthuse, had a monopoly on the sale of Bruges “gruut” that lasted late into&nbsp;the 16th
  century. At the same time, taxes were levied to the Count&nbsp;of Flanders. In BRUGGE Tripel, this medieval tradition
  continues.</p>
<h2>Bruges yeast</h2>
<p>BRUGGE Tripel gets its willful aroma from the use of a topfermenting&nbsp;yeast strain which gives a dominant,
  smoked, phenolic&nbsp;aroma.</p>

<h2>Bottle conditioning</h2>
<p>BRUGGE Tripel undergoes a second fermentation in the bottle.&nbsp;During filling, some sugar and yeast are added
  which ferment&nbsp;into alcohol and carbon dioxide gas in the “hot chamber”. This&nbsp;is why BRUGGE Tripel has a high
  carbon dioxide content, which&nbsp;gives the beer added zest. The yeast sediment at the bottom&nbsp;of the bottle
  protects the beer against oxidation, thus preventing&nbsp;rapid ageing of the taste. The presence of the yeast causes
  the&nbsp;flavours to develop over time. This makes BRUGGE Tripel a true&nbsp;stock beer.</p>
