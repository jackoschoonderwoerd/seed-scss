<p>This ale type, which was given the name PALM Royale (ROY-ALE), was created in 2003&nbsp;for PALM brewer Alfred Van
  Roy’s 90th birthday. His passion for the distinct fermentation&nbsp;fruitiness of his personally selected PALM yeast
  is perfectly embodied in PALM&nbsp;Royale: a real royal treat of a beer. Its appearance is copper-coloured, with a
  rich, white&nbsp;head which clings to the glass. The aroma is reminiscent of banana, the flavour has bite&nbsp;with a
  great deal of body. The beer is slightly sweet due to the alcohol, but is nevertheless&nbsp;somewhat bitter and fruity
  too.</p>

<h2>PALM amber-coloured malts</h2>

<p>Unique amber-coloured malts determine the basic flavour of PALM Royale: mild caramel&nbsp;flavours with a honey-like
  mellowness. The malting process adheres to PALM’s specific&nbsp;instructions, which are aimed at a natural brown
  colouring that gives the beer its specific&nbsp;flavour.</p>

<h2>PALM yeast</h2>

<p>The aroma is determined to a significant extent by yeast.&nbsp;Through intensive selection, the Van Roy family has
  amassed&nbsp;a lavish collection of the various yeast strains, each of which&nbsp;gives the beer its own fruity
  character. PALM Royale is fermented&nbsp;with a yeast strain which provides a distinct banana-&nbsp;like fruitiness.

<h2>The PALM Royale glass</h2>

<p>A special glass for a real royal treat:<br>
  • On a long stem, inviting that tasting moment.<br>
  • A goblet shape curving inward slightly towards the top&nbsp;to allow PALM Royale’s extreme banana fruitiness to<br>
  really come out.<br>
  • Tapering towards the bottom in order to maintain the height&nbsp;of the head as the glass is drained.</p>
