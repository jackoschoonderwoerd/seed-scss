Picture: Mensje van Keulen, by Mark Kohn Which portrait photographer puts his models at ease by playing them an irresistible Laurel & Hardy cartoon on his iPad? The result is a portrait where even the shyest models have that sparkle in their eyes. It is only one of the tricks Mark Kohn uses to get the portraits he desires. He considers the right atmosphere and a bond of trust between the model and the photographer his personal responsibility and an absolute imperative to take a beautiful picture. This way, he can make portraits that can withstand the test of time. Mark Kohn (1961, self-taught) has chosen to ignore the milestone of him being a photographer for 25 years, preferring to show his more recent work.
