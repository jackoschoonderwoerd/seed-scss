  his inspiration from his daily work as a musician. At his exhibition ‘JAZZSESSION’ you find some of his art he made
  between 2017 and 2018 which are announcements for the weekly notorious and probably the longest running jazzsession in
  Holland (39 years) in Café De seed-scss in Amsterdam, a place where he plays each sunday since 1994.
