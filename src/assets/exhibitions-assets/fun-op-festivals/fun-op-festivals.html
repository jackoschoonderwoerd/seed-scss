Outdoor festivals are visually attractive. The extravagant outfits, the liquor and the frenzied rhythms create beautiful celebrations with dancing, raving masses. Every festival has its own unique guests and its own vibe. Miller did take photos at the bigger festivals, like Dance Valley and Mysteryland, but finds the smaller festivals, like the Wave Festival in â€˜t Twiske (Amsterdam North), more rewarding to shoot, because they are more localized, less commercial and far more original. Ordinarily, Miller works as a news photographer, throwing himself willingly into danger to take photos of riots, fights and police arrests. Therefore, festivals are a breath of fresh air for the photographer.
